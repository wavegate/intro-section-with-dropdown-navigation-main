## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- Justifying and aligning specific items (not all) in a grid.
- Creating a dropdown menu.
- Creating a burger (open) and cross (close) button using CSS.
- Creating a side navigation menu for responsive design.

### Continued development

Writing the CSS for this simple site was a huge mess, and I need more practice with navigation. I plan to redo this challenge (going to take a break from it for now). At this level, I think it might be a good time to learn some more strategies for organizing CSS. I've heard about SASS/SCSS and frameworks like Tailwind, and I think it's a good time to start taking a look at what they're capable of. I also think I should incorporate block-element-modifier naming convention to keep myself organized. But mostly, I think I just need more practice dealing with more and more complicated layouts to get used to how to organize them effectively. I'm noticing the names I'm giving my elements and how they are nested within each other are starting to get confusing.
